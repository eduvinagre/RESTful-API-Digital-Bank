# Digital Bank RESTful API

This is a digital bank RESTful API project I made for Cubos Academy challenge. I used Node.JS, Express, Nodemon, and date-fns to build this project. The API is able to create an account, list existing accounts, delete an account, update the user info, make financial operations such as withdrawals, deposits, transfers, show account balance, and last but not least show the bank statement with all user registrations.
